# Slop.sh

This is a personal site I'm actively working on. It uses NextJS, TailwindCSS, framer-motion and more. There's no reason for you to want to locally run this, but the instructions are below if you need them.

## Running the project
*Using pnpm because pnpm is awesome*

### To install dependencies

```
pnpm i
```

### To run the development server

```
pnpm dev
```

### For a production build

```
pnpm build
```

### For prettier

```
pnpm format
```
